# 🐒 Monkey Programming Language (Go Implementation)

This project is my step-by-step journey of building the **Monkey programming language interpreter** in Go, following the _Writing An Interpreter In Go_ book.

It’s a learning project focused on:

- Understanding how programming languages work.
- Improving my Go skills.
- Building a real-world interpreter from scratch.

## 🚀 Project Structure

| Folder | Purpose                                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| lexer  | Scans input and produces tokens                             |
| token  | Defines the types of tokens used                            |
| parser | (Coming soon) Build AST from tokens                         |
| ast    | (Coming soon) Abstract Syntax Tree definitions              |
| object | (Coming soon) Runtime objects like integers, booleans, etc. |
| repl   | (Coming soon) Read-Eval-Print Loop                          |
